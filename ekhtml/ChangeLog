2002-11-10  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Fix 3 compilation bugs found by Paul Marquis.  They primarily
	deal with undeclared function prototypes, and non-C++ compatable
	headers.

2002-09-25  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Fixed a critical bug which was introduced in 0.3.0, where
	specific start and endtags were not having their callbacks called.

2002-09-20  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Added the test_bogus_feedsize.sh test in order to test
	rare cases where the output may be incorrect on certain
	feed sizes.
	
	*  Optimized comment parsing -- seems about 4% faster on my 
	large doc test.

2002-09-17  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Removed dependence on APR.  El-Kabong now compiles 
	standalone.

2002-09-16  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Changed all the APIs which previously took a char */length 
	pair into taking a ekhtml_string_t type, which wraps the same
	data.

2002-09-12  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Released version 0.2.0

2001-12-18  Jon Travis  <jtravis@covalent.net>

	*  Remove unneeded pool allocation and destruction from endtag
	code.  Also cleaned up some of the code in special tag processing.

	*  Further optimized character map lookups.  Instead of 5 tables
	storing binary values, we store them all in 1 table, and logical
	AND them with masks to look for the appropriate characters.  
	The speedup is small but shows up in benchmarks.

2001-03-26  Jon Travis  <jtravis@covalent.net>

	*  Made a few optimizations.  Shaves about 16% off my test cases.
	YMMV.

2001-03-23  Jon Travis  <jtravis@covalent.net>

	*  Fixed bug with incorrect callback data being sent to the parser
	callback functions.  Also added a test for the condition.

2001-03-22  Jon Travis  <jtravis@covalent.net>

	*  Revamped pretty much everything.  A redesign in the archetecture
	allowed us to do some keen stuff:  added the ability comment callbacks,
	fixed boolean attribute parsing, forgive more brizz0k3n HTML.  This
	should also be a fairly speedy implementation.

2001-03-19  Jon Travis  <jtravis@covalent.net>

	* Initial version released.  This version still has some
	issues with poorly written HTML (i.e. <FOO<BAR>hello</BAR></FOO>)
	which it could handle better.  In addition, attributes with no
	direct value aren't supported yet.  I.e <FOO BAR>  And finally,
	I'd like to maintain state inbetween tag calls, to speed it up
	quite a bit.
