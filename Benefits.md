OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:

- Encryption
> - No one else can read your instant messages.

- Authentication
> - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.

- Deniability
> - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
> > checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
> > conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
> > _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
> > he sees are authentic and unmodified.

- Perfect forward secrecy

> - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
> > is compromised.
