# Introduction #
MirOTR no longer support the ANSI version, because there are two reasons:

1) There is only one reason to use the ANSI build of Miranda IM or its plugins: For users who are still on Windows 98 or Windows ME. There are also no point in supporting the ANSI version any longer.

2) ANSI is completely untested. In fact, no one cares about the ANSI builds, no one tests them. Even developers only verify that the builds compile and that's it. Bugs are very likely to exist in the ANSI build of MirOTR and in my opinion, it is better to drop an unsupported build than releasing it full of bugs.

## Latest ANSI version ##
You can get the latest ANSI MirOTR version [here](http://code.google.com/p/mirotr/downloads/detail?name=MirOTR_0.10.3.1.zip).

## OS support ##
For MirOTR, the following platforms are supported:

**Win32 UNICODE** - minimum supported operating system: Windows XP (although, the build should work on Windows 2000, but at this point it is untested!).

**Windows x64 UNICODE** - minimum supported operating system: Windows Vista/7 x64 (Windows XP x64 should work though, but it is untested and unsupported).
