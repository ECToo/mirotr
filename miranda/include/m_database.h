/******************* DATABASE MODULE ***************************/

/*	Notes (as I think of them):
- The module is 100% thread-safe
- The database is the main routing point for the vast majority of Miranda.
  Events are sent from the protocol module to here, and the send/recv message
  module (for example) hooks the db/event/added event. Events like 'contact
  online status changed' do not come through here - icqlib will send that one.
- contacts work much the same. the find/add users module calls db/contact/add
  and db/contact/writesetting and the contact list will get db/contact/added
  and db/contact/settingchanged events
- The user is just a special contact. A hcontact of NULL in most functions
  means the user. Functions in which it cannot be used will be stated
- events attached to the user are things like system messages
- also in this module are crypt/decrypt functions for stuff that should be
  obfuscated on the disk, and some time functions for dealing with timestamps
  in events.
- the contactsettings system is designed for being read by many different
  modules. eg lots of people will be interested in "ICQ"/"UIN", but the module
  name passed to contact/writesetting should always be your own. The Mirabilis
  ICQ database importer clearly has to be an exception to this rule, along with
  a few other bits.
- the current database format means that geteventcontact is exceptionally slow.
  It should be avoidable in most cases so I'm not too concerned, but if people
  really need to use it a lot, I'll sort it out.
- handles do not need to be closed unless stated
- the database is loaded as a memory mapped file. This has various
  disadvantages but a massive advantage in speed for random access.
- The database is optimised for reading. Write performance is fairly bad,
  except for adding events which is the most common activity and pretty good.
- I'll work on caching to improve this later
- Deleted items are left as empty space and never reused. All new items are
  put at the end. A count is kept of this slack space and at some point a
  separate programme will need to be written to repack the database when the
  slack gets too high. It's going to be a good few months of usage before this
  can happen to anyone though, so no rush.

Look up the value of a named setting for a specific contact in the database
  wParam=(WPARAM)(HANDLE)hContact

hContact should have been returned by find*contact or addcontact
Caller is responsible for free()ing dbcgs.pValue->pszVal and pbVal if they are
returned. This should be done with db/contact/freevariant if you have your own
heap (like DLLs do).
Note that DBCONTACTGETSETTING takes a pointer to a DBVARIANT, whereas
DBCONTACTWRITESETTING contains a DBVARIANT.
Returns 0 on success or nonzero if the setting name was not found or hContact
was invalid
Because this is such a common function there are some short helper function at
the bottom of this header that use it.

(Added during 0.3.3+ development!!)

If a setting is queried under for contact and it is deleted it will
not be returned as a successful attempt, prior to 0.3.3 a *deleted*
setting would be successfully read (which was a bug because the pValue
was often garbage and maybe not even NULL terminated)

To test for existing but 'deleted' settings, the return value will
be 2, and pValue->type==DBVT_DELETED, at this point pValue is undefined.

Look up the value of a named setting for a specific contact in the database
  wParam=(WPARAM)(HANDLE)hContact
  lParam=(LPARAM)(DBCONTACTGETSETTING*)&dbcgs
hContact should have been returned by find*contact or addcontact
This service differs from db/contact/getsetting in that it won't malloc()
memory for the return value if it needs to do so. This introduces some extra
constraints:
Upon calling dbcgs.pValue->type should be initialised to the expected type of
the setting. If the setting is of an integral type it won't matter if it's
wrong and the service will correct it before returning, however if the setting
is a string or a blob the service needs to know where to put the data and will
fail if type is set wrongly.
If dbcgs.pValue->type is DBVT_ASCIIZ or DBVT_BLOB upon calling, the
corresponding data field (pszVal or pbVal) must point to a buffer allocated by
the caller and the length field (cchVal or cpbVal) must contain the size of
that buffer in bytes.
If the setting type is variable length (DBVT_ASCIIZ or DBVT_BLOB), on exit the
length field (cchVal or cpbVal) will be filled with the full length of the
setting's value (excluding the terminating nul if it's DBVT_ASCIIZ).
This service exists as well as db/contact/getsetting because malloc()/free()
can be too slow for frequently queried settings.
Returns 0 on success or nonzero if the setting name was not found or hContact
was invalid.

Free the memory in a DBVARIANT that is allocated by a call to

This service is actually just a wrapper around a call to free() and a test to
check that it is a string or a blob in the variant. It exists because DLLs have
their own heap and cannot free the memory allocated in db/contact/getsetting.
Thus it need not be called if you know the variant contains some form of int,
and you will often see free() used instead in code written before I noticed
this problem.
Good style, of course, dictates that it should be present to match all calls to
db/contact/getsetting, but that's not going to happen of course.
There's a helper function for this at the bottom of this header too.

would have been in place at the time of the stamp and gives the local time as
it would have been at the time and date the stamp contains.
This service isn't nearly as useful as db/time/TimestampToString below and I

mixed up (like I did. Living at GMT makes things easier for me, but has certain

Miranda's database is normally protected against corruption by agressively
flushing data to the disk on writes. If you're doing a lot of writes (eg in
an import plugin) it can sometimes be desirable to switch this feature off to
speed up the process. If you do switch it off, you must remember that crashes
are far more likely to be catastrophic, so switch it back on at the earliest
possible opportunity.
Note that if you're doing a lot of setting writes, the flush is already delayed

Writing to the database while module names are being enumerated will cause
unpredictable results in the enumeration, but the write will work.
szModuleName is only guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the callback.
If you want to keep it for longer you must allocation your own storage.
**BUG**: Prior to 0.1.2.0 dbmep was called as (lParam)(szMod,ofsMod,lParam).
